                  <b>Risk Cover/ Risk Surcharge: </b>
                  Our customers can opt for a risk cover for their consignment. It is like an insurance and covers the holder for the value of the shipment in case of any loss in transit or faulty packaging. We charge a non-refundable risk surcharge equivalent to 2% of the invoice value. Instances where the customer has insured the shipments on his own, a risk surcharge equivalent to 0.2% of the invoice is charged for the Certificate of Facts to fulfil requirements of the customer and take subsequent claims from their insurance company.

                  This service can be clubbed with ToPay. We collect COD/DOD from the consignee/receiver and hand the same to the consignor/sender.
                  This provision is only available for our corporate / credit client.
